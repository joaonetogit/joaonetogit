### Hey! 🚀

🎓 I have a degree in Information Systems from the University of Pernambuco (UPE) and I am currently focused on improving my skills in front-end and back-end development.

👨🏻‍💻 As a front-end professional, I have accumulated more than two years of experience honing my technical and communication skills, creating unique layouts for WordPress using technologies such as HTML, PHP, Sass, Webpack and JavaScript. I also have experience creating applications and websites with ReactJS / NextJS, Typescript, Styled Components, Storybook, TailwindCSS and other emerging tools and frameworks.

🖥️  With over five years' experience working in the WordPress environment, especially integrating with Elementor, I have developed several corporate websites and online stores. During my career, I have collaborated with digital marketing agencies and worked independently as a freelance professional.

🚀 I have a keen interest in various aspects of front-end development, such as interface design, emerging technologies, innovative methods and documentation. Constantly learning is essential to keep up with the latest developments in the world of web development.
