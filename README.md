### Hey! 🚀

🎓 I have a degree in Information Systems from the University of Pernambuco and a strong interest in technology.

💻 Currently, my work focuses on front-end development, where I work on creating custom WordPress themes using technologies such as HTML, PHP, Sass, Webpack and JavaScript. I also develop applications and websites using ReactJS/NextJS, Typescript, Styled Components, Storybook, and other cutting-edge libraries and frameworks.

🖥️ I have over five years of development experience using the WordPress ecosystem, including Elementor integration, resulting in the creation of institutional websites and online stores. During this time, I have provided services to digital marketing agencies and worked as a freelancer.

👨🏻‍💻 As a front-end developer, I have accumulated more than two years of experience, continuously improving and developing my technical and essential interpersonal skills. I keep myself updated by taking specialized courses in the field and by following relevant content on YouTube and Medium.

🚀 I have a keen interest in a number of areas related to front-end development, including UI design, emerging technologies, innovative methodologies, and documentation writing. I firmly believe that continuous learning is the key to keeping up with the latest trends in the web development world.

☕ In addition to my passion for technology, I am also interested in other topics such as finance, music and movies.
