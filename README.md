### Hey! 🚀

🎓 I got my degree in Information Systems from the University of Pernambuco and I'm very interested in technology.

💻 I currently work in front-end development, working with custom WordPress themes with HTML/PHP, Sass, Webpack and JavaScript and I also develop with ReactJS, Typescript, Styled Components, Storybook, among others.

🖥️ I have more than 5 years of development experience using WordPress + Elementor, and its integrations, to create institutional websites and online stores. During this time, I've worked for digital marketing agencies and as a freelancer.
