### Hey! 🚀

🎓 I graduated in Information Systems from Pernambuco University and have a strong interest in technology.

💻 Presently, I center my attention on front-end development by designing custom WordPress themes utilizing technologies like HTML, PHP, Sass, Webpack, and JavaScript. As well, I craft applications and websites by utilizing ReactJS/NextJS, Typescript, Styled Components, Storybook, TailwindCSS, and other innovative libraries and frameworks.

🖥️ With over five years of experience in developing on the WordPress ecosystem, including Elementor integration, I have created institutional websites and e-commerce stores. Throughout my tenure, I have served digital marketing agencies while also freelancing.

👨🏻‍💻 As a front-end developer, I have more than two years of experience, convalescing my technical and interpersonal skills relentlessly. I stay current by taking specialized courses and following relevant content on platforms such as YouTube and Medium.

🚀 I have a strong interest in various aspects of front-end development, including UI design, emerging technologies, innovative methodologies, and documentation writing. Continuing to learn is crucial to staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
