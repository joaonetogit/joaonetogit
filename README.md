### Hey! 🚀

🎓 I graduated in Information Systems from Pernambuco University and have a strong interest in technology.

💻 Currently, my main focus revolves around advancing applications and websites within the React ecosystem. I work with technologies such as ReactJS, NextJS, Typescript, Styled Components, Storybook, TailwindCSS and other cutting-edge libraries and frameworks. In addition, my experience extends to front-end development, where I create custom WordPress themes using a toolset that includes HTML, PHP, CSS/Sass, Webpack and JavaScript. This multi-faceted approach allows me to seamlessly blend creativity with technology, ensuring optimal user experiences and visually stunning designs.

🖥️ With over five years of experience in developing on the WordPress ecosystem, including Elementor integration, I have created institutional websites and e-commerce stores. Throughout my tenure, I have served digital marketing agencies while also freelancing.

👨🏻‍💻 As a front-end developer, I have more than two years of experience, convalescing my technical and interpersonal skills relentlessly. I stay current by taking specialized courses and following relevant content on platforms such as YouTube and Medium.

🚀 I have a strong interest in various aspects of front-end development, including UI design, emerging technologies, innovative methodologies, and documentation writing. Continuing to learn is crucial to staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
